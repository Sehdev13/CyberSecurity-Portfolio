A motivated cybersecurity enthusiast committed to continuous growth and real-world learning. Actively involved in hands-on projects, security labs, and investigative research to better understand modern threats and defense strategies. Driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and a strong interest in strengthening security across systems and networks.

## Objective

Driven by curiosity about how attacks unfold and how systems can be defended, I’m pursuing a transition into cybersecurity with the goal of joining a SOC as a Tier 1 Analyst. I’m ready to take on real-world challenges, learn rapidly, and support a team dedicated to keeping environments secure.
